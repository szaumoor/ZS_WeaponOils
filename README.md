# ZS_WeaponOils
This small mod simply adds a new class of items called "weapon oils". Essentially, they are consumable potions that apply a somewhat mild melee/ranged effect to your melee and ranged attacks for 1 turn. The poison-based ones do have the risk of self-poisoning, if dexterity is below 16. The effects all bypass magic resistance, except in the case of Arcane Oil (which is offset by the higher damage).

They are distributed to stores so far and a few select creatures. Compatibility with IWDEE not established yet, because I can't be bothered to check what stores there are and how to decide which stores make the most sense to place the items in. Feel free to offer feedback on this.

Note that you cannot stack oils with themselves or each other, they are all set up so only one of them can be active. This of course can be abused with any other mods that may add similar items. If any of you can think of another mod that adds stuff like this, I can add some code to handle it so balance is not broken.

Also, I'm not a good writer, so the descriptions are pretty boring, and most of the icons were lazily made, but I think they're visually  distinguishable enough.

These are the available oils:

-**Igneous** Oil: 1d2+1 fire damage (Save vs. Breath for half)
- **Caustic** Oil: 1d2+1 acid damage (Save vs. Breath for half)
- **Gelid** Oil: 1d2+1 cold damage (Save vs. Breath for half)
- **Scintillating** Oil: 1d2+1 electric damage (Save vs. Breath for half)
- **Arcane** Oil: 1d4+2 magic damage (no save allowed)
- **Noxious** Oil: 1d2+1 poison damage (Save vs. Death at +2 or suffer 6 points of poison damage over 2 rounds)
- **Drow** **Soporific** Oil: Save vs. Death or fall into a deep slumber for 1 turn (damage will awaken the target)
- **Sanctified** Oil: +4 irresistible damage against the undead, must Save vs. Death at +2 or become Slowed and Weakened for 10 seconds
- **Profane** Oil: as sanctified oil, but only works vs. the living
- **Kuo-Toan** Oil of **Stunning**: Save vs. Spell at +2 or become stunned for 2 rounds. Very limited in quantity.
- **Dragon Bile** Extract: +1 poison damage (nondragons), Save vs. Death or have strength and movement speed reduced to half for 5 rounds. Only true pure dragons are unaffected.
- **Dragonsbane** Oil: 1d3+1 poison damage (non-draconic only), or 1d6+2 poison damage (draconic only). All dragons and cousins are severely weakened for one round and may have their Stoneskin or Improved Invisibility disrupted. The weakening effect wears off in intensity over three rounds.

## Compatibility
Should be compatible with everything as far as I know. Please offer feedback on balance and the supply of oils throughout the game if you try this.

## Known issues
The noxious oil sometimes seems to not offer log feedback indicating whether the poisoning was resisted or not. I don't think it affects functionality though.

Additionally, applying the oils through the inventory will be through a button that states "drink potion", which doesn't make sense (trust me, don't drink them for real, you'll die), but I don't think that can be helped.

## Acknowledgments and credits
Many thanks to zenblack for providing great icons for the oils, as well as other modders such as The Artisan in the discord servers that helped me figure out some of the issues and ideas I've had for this mod.
