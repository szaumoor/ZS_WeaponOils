# Changelog

- Added compatibility bits for Pits of Despair
- Added configuration options for Pits of Despair: whether to include them, which to include, and how many of each oil to include
- Added configuration options to determine the price of the oils, giving users more control over the economy. Defaults are as they were at the initial release
- Now the mod also patches fighters and rangers so they have a chance of holding 1-2 igneous, scintillating, or gelid oils (15% default)
- Mages, mage/thieves, fighter/thieves, sorcerers, and bards, have a chance of holding 1 arcane oil (25% default)
- Fighter/Mage/Thieves no longer have a chance of getting noxious or drow oils
- Patches also clerics and paladins so they get 1 sanctified or profane oil depending on alignment (20% chance). Neutral ones had a 50-50 chance of getting either (15% chance). Blackguards also have a 50% chance of spawning with 1 noxious oil in their inventory.
- Joinable characters no longer are candidate for random placement of oils
